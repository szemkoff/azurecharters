## FAQ Section

**Section Title:** "Frequently Asked Questions"

**Question 1:**
- **Q:** "What factors affect yacht insurance premiums?"
- **A:** "Key factors include the vessel's value, age, construction, and flag; owner and crew experience; cruising regions and seasons; claims history; and desired deductible levels. Risk management measures such as professional crew, security systems, and hurricane plans can positively impact premiums."

**Question 2:**
- **Q:** "How does charter use affect my insurance coverage?"
- **A:** "Charter operation typically requires additional coverage elements, including enhanced liability protection, charter income coverage, and specific crew considerations. Many standard yacht policies exclude or severely restrict charter use, making specialized coverage essential for any commercial operation."

**Question 3:**
- **Q:** "What is an 'agreed value' policy and why is it important?"
- **A:** "Unlike auto insurance which typically pays actual cash value, yacht insurance operates on an 'agreed value' basis, meaning the insurer agrees to pay the stated amount in case of total loss without depreciation. This approach provides certainty regarding claim settlement and eliminates valuation disputes during the claims process."

**Question 4:**
- **Q:** "How does navigation territory affect my coverage?"
- **A:** "Your policy specifies approved navigation territories where coverage remains fully in effect. Cruising outside these areas without prior approval can void coverage. We specialize in securing appropriate coverage for planned itineraries and arranging territory extensions when travel plans change."
