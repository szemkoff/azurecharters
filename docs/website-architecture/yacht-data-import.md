This guide explains how to bulk import yacht listings into your Tilda website using CSV files.

## CSV Format Overview

## Product Variants Structure

For each yacht, you can create multiple variants based on:
1. Charter duration (Week, Day, Half-day)
2. Package type (Basic, Premium, All-inclusive)

In the CSV file, only the first row for each yacht contains all details. Subsequent variants only need:
- Title (same as the main listing)
- SKU (unique for each variant)
- Price information
- Charter_Duration
- Package_Type
- Additional_Info specific to that variant

## Importing to Tilda

To import the CSV file into Tilda:

1. Log in to your Tilda admin dashboard
2. Navigate to **Store â†’ Products**
3. Click the **Import** button
4. Select the CSV file
5. Match the CSV columns to Tilda fields
6. Review the data preview
7. Click **Import** to begin the process

## Sample CSV Template

We've created a sample CSV template with two yacht listings and their variants, which you can find at:
`/charter-framework/yacht-listings-template.csv`

## Best Practices

1. **Images**: Ensure all image URLs are publicly accessible
2. **SKUs**: Create a consistent SKU system (e.g., yachtcode-duration-package)
3. **Variants**: Include all variants even if not immediately available
4. **Descriptions**: Keep main descriptions concise for better display
5. **Pricing**: Include both current and old prices for marketing appeal

## Troubleshooting

- **Image Import Failures**: Verify image URLs are correct and accessible
- **Character Encoding**: Save CSV files in UTF-8 format
- **Quotation Marks**: Enclose text fields in double quotes, especially if they contain commas
- **Field Mapping**: Check field mapping carefully during the import process
