# Website Architecture Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the recommended website architecture for Azure Yacht Group, utilizing Tilda for both of our online properties.

## Two-Website Strategy

Azure Yacht Group maintains two separate but coordinated websites:

1. **azureyachtgroup.com (Project ID: 4198911)**
   - Main corporate site focusing on Yacht Brokerage and Yacht Design
   - Target audience: Yacht buyers, sellers, and design clients
   - Includes a featured charter section on the home page with link to the dedicated charter site

2. **azurcharters.com (Project ID: 12993249)**
   - Dedicated charter business website 
   - Target audience: Charter clients and charter-specific investors
   - Note: This separation exists because we have a dedicated investor for the charter business only

Both websites maintain brand cohesion while allowing for business separation.

## Core Architecture Principles

Both websites follow these principles:

1. **Client-Centered Design**: Pages optimized for specific client needs (brokerage vs. charter)
2. **Conversion-Focused Layout**: Strategic placement of inquiry CTAs
3. **SEO-Optimized Structure**: Logical hierarchy for search engines
4. **Mobile-First Approach**: Fully responsive across all devices
5. **Fast Loading Performance**: Optimized media and code
6. **Consistent Brand Experience**: Visual cohesion between both properties
