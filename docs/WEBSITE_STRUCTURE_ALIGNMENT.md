# Website Structure Alignment

## Overview
This document compares the sales-optimized website structure against the current implementation, identifying gaps and providing recommendations for alignment. Last updated: May 7, 2025.

## Website Domains and Organization Structure

The Azure Yacht Group's online presence is strategically divided into two separate websites:

1. **azureyachtgroup.com** (Project ID: 4198911)
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on Yacht Brokerage and Yacht Design business pillars
   - **Content**: Main Azure Yacht Group corporate presence, brokerage services, and design services
   - **Target Audience**: Yacht buyers, sellers, and design clients

2. **azurcharters.com** (Project ID: 12993249)
   - **Purpose**: Dedicated to the Charter business pillar
   - **Content**: Charter offerings, destinations, and charter-specific services
   - **Target Audience**: Charter clients and charter investors
   - **Note**: This separation is due to having a dedicated investor for the charter business only

This separation allows for focused marketing, targeted client acquisition, and independent business operations while maintaining brand consistency across both properties.

## Current vs. Planned Structure

### Charter Section on Main Website

To maintain visibility of the charter business while supporting the separate investor structure, the azureyachtgroup.com home page will include a dedicated "Charter Services" section with:

1. **Charter Introduction**: Brief overview of charter services
2. **Featured Charter Yachts**: 2-3 highlighted vessels from the charter fleet
3. **Charter Destination Highlights**: Visual showcase of key charter destinations
4. **Clear Charter CTA**: Prominent "Explore Charter Options" button linking to azurcharters.com

This approach allows the main website to showcase all business pillars while directing charter-focused traffic to the dedicated charter website.

By following the recommended actions and timeline, both websites can be transformed into high-converting sales assets that effectively showcase their respective services.
