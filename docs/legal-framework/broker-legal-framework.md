## Florida-Specific Regulatory Considerations

### Tax Compliance

Florida imposes a 6% state sales tax plus local option taxes (potentially totaling 7-8%) on yacht charters. Key considerations:

- Collection process must be documented in all charter agreements
- Tax must be clearly identified in all client invoices
- Monthly remittance to Florida Department of Revenue required
- Potential exemptions must be properly documented (rare)
- Charter broker responsible for compliance verification

### USCG Requirements

All charter vessels must comply with U.S. Coast Guard regulations:

- Proper documentation/registration (verified by broker)
- Appropriate USCG certifications for crew members
- Adherence to passenger capacity regulations
- Safety equipment requirements
- Compliance with inspection schedules
- Drug testing program for crew members

### Local Regulations

Charter operations must adhere to various local regulations:

- Marina and anchorage restrictions in Florida waters
- Environmental protection requirements (no-discharge zones)
- Local noise ordinances
- Special protected areas (coral reefs, marine reserves)
- Local permitting where applicable

## Major Legal Risks & Mitigation

| Risk Area | Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|-----------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Yacht Misrepresentation** | Inaccurate specifications or condition information | Independent verification protocol and liability clause in owner agreement |
| **Service Quality** | Client dissatisfaction with yacht/crew performance | Clear disclaimer of broker responsibility and complaint procedure |
| **Payment Disputes** | Disagreements over deposits, refunds, or damages | Escrow account, clear contract terms, dispute resolution process |
| **Tax Liability** | Improper handling of Florida sales tax | Documented collection and remittance process, regular compliance audits |
| **Regulatory Violations** | Non-compliance with USCG or maritime regulations | Comprehensive compliance checklist, verification procedures |
| **Commission Bypassing** | Owner-client direct booking on future charters | Strong non-circumvention clauses with monetary penalties |
| **Insurance Coverage Gaps** | Inadequate insurance for charter activities | Insurance verification process, coverage requirements in contracts |
| **IYBA Standards Violation** | Non-compliance with IYBA requirements | Regular IYBA compliance audits, staff training, updated procedures |
