**Referral Rock → HubSpot:**
```javascript
// New referral webhook
{
  "endpoint": "https://api.hubapi.com/contacts/v1/contact/",
  "events": ["referral.created", "referral.converted", "commission.approved"],

  "trigger": "deal.propertyChange",
  "conditions": {
    "dealstage": "closedwon",
    "referral_source": "not_empty"
  }
}
```

### 3.2 Custom Tracking Implementation

#### URL Generation for Influencers

```javascript
// Generate unique tracking URLs
function generateReferralURL(partnerId, destination) {
  const baseURL = "https://azurcharters.com";
  const trackingParams = {
    ref: partnerId,
    utm_source: "referral",
    utm_medium: "partner",
    utm_campaign: "influencer_program",
    utm_content: partnerId
  };
  
  return `${baseURL}${destination}?${new URLSearchParams(trackingParams)}`;
}

// Example output:
// https://azurcharters.com/fleet?ref=INF001&utm_source=referral&utm_medium=partner&utm_campaign=influencer_program&utm_content=INF001
```

#### Tracking Script for Website

```javascript
// Add to Tilda website
(function() {
  // Capture referral parameters
  const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
  const referralCode = urlParams.get('ref');
  
  if (referralCode) {
    // Store in localStorage for attribution
    localStorage.setItem('azure_referral_code', referralCode);
    localStorage.setItem('azure_referral_timestamp', Date.now());
    
    // Send to HubSpot for tracking
    if (typeof _hsq !== 'undefined') {
      _hsq.push(['identify', {
