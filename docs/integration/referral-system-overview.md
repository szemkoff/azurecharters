# Referral System Overview

## System Architecture

Azure Yacht Group's referral system is designed to reward partners for bringing quality yacht charter leads while maintaining complete transparency and automated tracking.

## How It Works

### 1. Partner Onboarding

- We review and approve qualified partners
- Partners receive unique referral codes and tracking materials

### 2. Lead Generation

- Customers mention the referral code when booking
- System automatically tracks and attributes referrals

### 3. Commission Processing

- Automatic notifications sent to partners
- Monthly payments processed via Zelle

### 4. Performance Tracking
- Real-time tracking in Google Sheets
- Monthly performance reports for partners

## Commission Structure

Our hybrid commission model rewards partners based on the revenue we generate from each booking:

|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| $300 | $100 | ~$5,000 |
| $500 | $150 | ~$7,500 |
