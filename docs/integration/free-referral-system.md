### Step 1: Create Partner Application Form (Google Forms)

Create a simple Google Form with these fields:

- Why do you want to promote yacht charters?
- How will you promote our services?
```

**Form Settings:**

- Send copy of responses to applicant: Yes
- Automatically send to Google Sheet: Yes

### Step 2: Create Referral Tracking Sheet

Create a Google Sheet with these tabs:

#### Tab 1: "Partners"
```
Column A: Partner ID (AUTO: PARTNER-001, PARTNER-002, etc.)
Column B: Partner Name
Column C: Email
Column D: Phone
Column E: Referral Code (AUTO: PARTNER-FIRSTNAME)
Column F: Status (Active/Inactive)
Column G: Join Date
Column H: Commission Rate (15%)
Column I: Total Referrals
Column J: Total Commissions Earned
Column K: Total Paid
Column L: Balance Due
```

Column C: Customer Email
Column D: Booking Date
Column E: Charter Date
Column F: Charter Value
Column G: Referral Code Used
Column H: Partner Name (VLOOKUP from Partners tab)

```

=COUNTIF(Bookings!G:G,E2)

Total Commissions Earned (Column J):
=SUMIF(Bookings!G:G,E2,Bookings!J:J)

Balance Due (Column L):
=J2-K2
```

#### In Bookings Tab:
```
Partner Name (Column H):
=VLOOKUP(G2,Partners!E:B,2,FALSE)

Commission Amount (Column J):
=F2*I2
```

### Step 4: Create Simple Tracking Links

#### Manual Method (Free):
For each partner, create simple tracking URLs:
```
Original: https://azureyachtgroup.com/charter-inquiry
Partner Link: https://azureyachtgroup.com/charter-inquiry?ref=PARTNER-JOHN

Or use Bit.ly for shorter links:
bit.ly/azure-john ‚Üí redirects to your site with ?ref=PARTNER-JOHN
```

#### Add Simple Tracking to Your Tilda Site:
```html
<!-- Add this to your Tilda site footer -->
<script>
// Simple referral tracking
const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
const refCode = urlParams.get('ref');

if (refCode) {
    // Store referral code in browser
    localStorage.setItem('referral_code', refCode);
    
    // Show referral message
    console.log('Referred by: ' + refCode);
    
    // Optional: Show discount message
    document.body.insertAdjacentHTML('afterbegin', 
        '<div style="background: #007bff; color: white; text-align: center; padding: 10px;">' +
        'Special offer! You were referred by one of our partners. Mention code "' + refCode + '" for 5% off!' +
        '</div>'
    );
}
</script>
```

### Step 5: Manual Booking Process

#### When Customer Contacts You:
1. **Ask about referral**: "How did you hear about us?"
2. **Record in sheet**: Add booking to "Bookings" tab
3. **Include referral code**: If they mention a partner or code

#### Simple Booking Entry:
```

- Email: john@email.com
- Booking Date: Today's date
- Charter Date: Charter date
- Charter Value: $5,000
- Referral Code: PARTNER-SARAH (if applicable)
- Commission Status: Pending
```

### Step 6: Free Email Notifications

2. **Use Google Sheets email function**:

```javascript
// Add this script to Google Sheets (Extensions > Apps Script)
function sendCommissionNotification(partnerEmail, partnerName, commissionAmount) {
  const subject = 'Commission Earned - Azure Yacht Group';
  const body = `
    Hi ${partnerName},
    
    Great news! You've earned a commission of $${commissionAmount} from a recent referral.
    
    Your commission will be paid at the end of the month along with your monthly statement.
    
    Keep up the great work!
    
    Best regards,
    Azure Yacht Group Team
  `;
  
  GmailApp.sendEmail(partnerEmail, subject, body);
}
```

### Step 7: Monthly Commission Process

#### End of Month Routine:
1. **Review Bookings tab**: Check all "Pending" commissions
2. **Update to "Paid"**: Change status after payment
3. **Send payments**: PayPal, Venmo, or bank transfer
4. **Send statements**: Email each partner their monthly summary

#### Simple Monthly Email:
```
