        data.action.data && data.action.data.listAfter && 
        data.action.data.listAfter.name === 'Proposal') {
      
      processReferral(data.action.data.card);
    }
    
    return ContentService.createTextOutput('OK');
  } catch (error) {
    console.log('Error:', error);
    return ContentService.createTextOutput('Error: ' + error.toString());
  }
}
```

**Data Processing:**
```javascript
function processReferral(card) {
  const sheet = SpreadsheetApp.getActiveSpreadsheet();
  const trackingSheet = sheet.getSheetByName('Tracking');
  
  // Parse card description for referral data
  const description = card.desc || '';
  const referralData = parseReferralData(description);
