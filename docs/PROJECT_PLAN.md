# Project Plan: Two-Website Business Framework Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive implementation plan for the Azure Yacht Group business framework, which now includes two separate websites to accommodate dedicated investment in the charter business. It serves as the master roadmap for development, integration, and deployment. Last updated: May 24, 2025.

## Website Structure Strategy

The Azure Yacht Group's online presence is strategically divided into two separate websites:

1. **azureyachtgroup.com (Project ID: 4198911)**
   - **Purpose**: Focuses on Yacht Brokerage and Yacht Design business pillars
   - **Content**: Main Azure Yacht Group corporate presence, brokerage services, and design services
   - **Target Audience**: Yacht buyers, sellers, and design clients

2. **azurcharters.com (Project ID: 12993249)**
   - **Purpose**: Dedicated to the Charter business pillar
   - **Content**: Charter offerings, destinations, and charter-specific services
   - **Target Audience**: Charter clients and charter investors
   - **Note**: This separation is due to having a dedicated investor for the charter business only

This separation allows for focused marketing, targeted client acquisition, and independent business operations while maintaining brand consistency across both properties.

## Current Phase: Phase 3 - Implementation Optimization

The project is currently in Phase 3, focusing on optimization of key systems, enhancement of sales conversion processes, integration of IYBA compliance standards across all business operations, and the separation of charter operations into a dedicated website.

## Recent Progress

✅ **API Integration Fixed**: The Tilda API integration issue has been resolved. The API now works with the original key lengths, enabling live content from Tilda instead of mock data.
